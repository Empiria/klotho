## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Use $HOME variable expansion in examples | Portability across systems; variable expansion is idiomatic |
| 01-02 | Support macOS via Podman Desktop and podman machine | User requirement for macOS compatibility |
| 01-02 | Document Homebrew as macOS package manager | Standard package manager for macOS developer tools |
| 01-02 | Include platform-specific troubleshooting sections | Different failure modes on Linux vs macOS require separate guidance |
| 01-03 | Use conditional checks for optional directories | Preserves "optional" semantics, better UX than requiring mkdir |
| 01-03 | Follow EXTRA_MOUNTS pattern for OPTIONAL_MOUNTS | Maintains codebase consistency with existing mount handling |
