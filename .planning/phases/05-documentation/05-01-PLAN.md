<objective>
Create README.md with overview, prerequisites, quick start, and concepts sections.

Purpose: Enable colleagues to understand the tool and start their first session in under 5 minutes.
Output: README.md with foundation sections that get users to first successful session.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create README with overview, prerequisites, and quick start</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md at repository root with these sections in order:

1. **Title and Overview** (conversational tone per CONTEXT.md):
   - Project title: "Agent Session"
   - One-paragraph value prop: what problem this solves (containerized AI agent environments with persistent sessions)
   - Who it's for (developers using AI coding agents)

2. **Prerequisites**:
   - Consolidate content from PREREQUISITES.md but streamlined
   - Include: Podman 4.0+, Bash 4.0+, ~/.claude.json
   - Each prerequisite: version requirement, verify command with expected output, install commands for Linux (apt) and macOS (brew)
   - macOS-specific: podman machine init/start requirement
   - Format verify commands as copy-paste safe (no brackets/pipes)

3. **Quick Start** (placed after prerequisites, before concepts per RESEARCH.md line 467):
   - Intro line: "Start your first agent session in under 5 minutes:"
   - Step 1: Clone and enter (use placeholder URL)
   - Step 2: Build the default agent (Claude) with `./scripts/build.sh claude`
   - Step 3: Start a session with `./agent-session start`
   - Step 4: Inside container note about Claude Code and Zellij
   - Step 5: Detach/reattach instructions
   - Step 6: Using with your project examples
   - Step 7: Agent selection with -a flag and interactive menu mention
   - All command blocks must be copy-paste safe

Do NOT include concepts yet - that's the next task.
Use conversational tone throughout (per CONTEXT.md).
  </action>
  <verify>
README.md exists at repository root with:
- Title "Agent Session"
- "## Prerequisites" section with podman, bash, ~/.claude.json
- "## Quick Start" section with numbered steps
- Verify commands are copy-paste safe (no brackets in code blocks)
- Quick start demonstrates agent selection (not just default)
  </verify>
  <done>
README.md has overview, prerequisites with verification commands, and quick start section with step-by-step path to first session.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add concepts section after quick start</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Add "## Concepts" section AFTER Quick Start (per RESEARCH.md line 467 recommendation - users anxious to see tool work first, concepts come after first success):

1. **Placement**: Insert after Quick Start, before any future Commands section

2. **Content** (brief explanations, 1-2 sentences each):
   - **Podman vs Docker**: "Like Docker but rootless, no daemon. Commands are nearly identical."
   - **Zellij vs tmux**: "Modern terminal multiplexer. Sessions persist - detach and reattach anytime."
   - **Agents**: "AI coding assistants (Claude Code, OpenCode). This tool creates isolated containers for them."

3. **Tone**: Conversational, reassuring for users unfamiliar with these technologies

The concepts section bridges knowledge gaps without creating cognitive overload before quick start.
  </action>
  <verify>
README.md concepts section:
- Located AFTER Quick Start section
- Explains podman vs docker
- Explains zellij vs tmux
- Explains what agents are
- Keep explanations brief (1-2 sentences each)
  </verify>
  <done>
Concepts section complete after quick start, explaining key technologies for mixed-knowledge audience.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completing both tasks, verify:
1. README.md exists at /home/owen/projects/personal/agent-session/README.md
2. Contains sections: Title, Prerequisites, Quick Start, Concepts (in that order per RESEARCH.md)
3. All verification commands have expected output format
4. No brackets, pipes, or special chars in code blocks (copy-paste safe)
5. Quick start demonstrates agent selection (not just default)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- README.md contains complete foundation sections
- A new user reading can understand prerequisites and verify their system
- Quick start path is achievable in under 5 minutes
- Concepts section (after quick start) clarifies podman/zellij/agents for mixed-knowledge audience
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-documentation/05-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
