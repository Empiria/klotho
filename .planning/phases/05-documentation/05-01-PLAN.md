<objective>
Create README.md with overview, prerequisites, concepts, and quick start sections.

Purpose: Enable colleagues to understand the tool and start their first session in under 5 minutes.
Output: README.md with foundation sections that get users to first successful session.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create README with overview, prerequisites, and concepts</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md at repository root with these sections in order:

1. **Title and Overview** (conversational tone per CONTEXT.md):
   - Project title: "Agent Session"
   - One-paragraph value prop: what problem this solves (containerized AI agent environments with persistent sessions)
   - Who it's for (developers using AI coding agents)

2. **Prerequisites**:
   - Consolidate content from PREREQUISITES.md but streamlined
   - Include: Podman 4.0+, Bash 4.0+, ~/.claude.json
   - Each prerequisite: version requirement, verify command with expected output, install commands for Linux (apt) and macOS (brew)
   - macOS-specific: podman machine init/start requirement
   - Format verify commands as copy-paste safe (no brackets/pipes)

3. **Concepts** (placed after prerequisites, before quick start per RESEARCH.md recommendation):
   - Podman vs Docker: "Like Docker but rootless, no daemon. Commands are nearly identical."
   - Zellij vs tmux: "Modern terminal multiplexer. Sessions persist - detach and reattach anytime."
   - Agents: "AI coding assistants (Claude Code, OpenCode). This tool creates isolated containers for them."
   - Keep explanations brief (1-2 sentences each)

Do NOT include quick start yet - that's the next task.
Use conversational tone throughout (per CONTEXT.md).
  </action>
  <verify>
README.md exists at repository root with:
- Title "Agent Session"
- "## Prerequisites" section with podman, bash, ~/.claude.json
- "## Concepts" section explaining key terms
- Verify commands are copy-paste safe (no brackets in code blocks)
  </verify>
  <done>
README.md has overview, prerequisites with verification commands, and concepts section explaining podman/zellij/agents.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add quick start section</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Add "## Quick Start" section after Concepts with these characteristics:

1. **Intro line**: "Start your first agent session in under 5 minutes:"

2. **Step 1 - Clone and enter**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/agent-session.git
   cd agent-session
   ```
   (Use placeholder URL - can be updated later)

3. **Step 2 - Build the default agent** (Claude):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh claude
   ```
   Brief note: "This builds the container image. Takes 2-3 minutes on first run."

4. **Step 3 - Start a session**:
   ```bash
   ./agent-session start
   ```
   Note: "This creates a session with current directory mounted at /workspace."

5. **Step 4 - (Inside container)** Claude Code starts automatically. Brief note about Zellij terminal.

6. **Step 5 - Detach and reattach**:
   - Detach: "Press Ctrl+C or close terminal - session keeps running"
   - Reattach: `./agent-session start` (same command reattaches)

7. **Using with your project**:
   ```bash
   ./agent-session start ~/myproject
   ./agent-session start -n webapp ~/webapp
   ```

8. **Agent selection** (per CONTEXT.md - show this, not just default Claude):
   ```bash
   ./agent-session start -a opencode ~/myproject
   ```
   Or run without -a flag for interactive menu.

All command blocks must be copy-paste safe (per RESEARCH.md Pattern 3).
Keep explanatory text minimal - one line per step where possible.
  </action>
  <verify>
README.md quick start section:
- Has numbered steps from clone to first session
- All code blocks are copy-paste safe
- Shows both default and explicit agent selection
- Mentions interactive menu option
- Total section is scannable (user can follow in ~5 minutes)
  </verify>
  <done>
Quick start section complete with step-by-step path to first session, including agent selection examples.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completing both tasks, verify:
1. README.md exists at /home/owen/projects/personal/agent-session/README.md
2. Contains sections: Title, Prerequisites, Concepts, Quick Start (in that order)
3. All verification commands have expected output format
4. No brackets, pipes, or special chars in code blocks (copy-paste safe)
5. Quick start demonstrates agent selection (not just default)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- README.md contains complete foundation sections
- A new user reading can understand prerequisites and verify their system
- Quick start path is achievable in under 5 minutes
- Concepts section clarifies podman/zellij/agents for mixed-knowledge audience
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-documentation/05-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
